//This file holds the definition of the Asymmetric Interpolation FIR reference model kernel class.
//Design Notes
//Note that the AIE intrinsics operate on increasing indices, but in a conventional FIR there is a convolution of data and coefficients.
//So as to achieve the impulse response from the filter which matches the coefficeint set, the coefficient array has to be reversed
//to compensate for the action of the intrinsics. This reversal is performed in the constructor where possible, or in the reference
//model's run-time filter function.
