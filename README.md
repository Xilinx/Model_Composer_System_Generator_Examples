## What's new in 2021.1?
Vitis Model Composer now contains the functionality of Xilinx System Generator for DSP.  Users who have been using Xilinx System Generator for DSP can continue development using Vitis Model Composer.

### AI Engines 
* A comprehensive constraint editor enables users to specify any constraint for AI Engine kernels in Vitis Model Composer. The generated ADF graph will contain these constraints.
* Addition of AI Engine FFT and IFFT blocks to the library browser. 
* Users now have access to many variations of AI Engine FIR blocks in the library browser. 
* Ability to specify filter coefficients using input ports for FIR filters. 
* Addition of two new utility blocks "RTP Source" and "To Variable Size".
* Enhanced AIE Kernel import block now also supports importing templatized AI Engine functions. 
* Ability to specify Xilinx platforms for AI Engine designs in the Hub block.
* Through the Hub block, users can relaunch Vitis Analyzer at any time after running AIE Simulation. 
* Users can now plot cycle approximate outputs and see estimated throughput for each output using Simulink Data Inspector. 
* Enhanced usability to import a graph as a block using only the graph header file. 
* Revamping of the progress bar with cancel button.
* Usability improvement during importing an AI Engine kernel or simulation of a design when MATLAB working directory and model directory are not the same. 
* Profiling during AIE Simulation is now disabled by default. It can be optionally enabled from the Model Composer Hub block.
* New TX Chain 200MHz example. 
* New 2d FFT examples showcasing designs with HLS, HDL, and AI Engine blocks.
### HDL
* Simulation speed enhancement for SSR FIR (more than 10x improvement), and SSR FFT.
* Simulation speed enhancement for memory blocks like RAMs, and FIFOs
* Questa Simulator updated with VHDL 2008 in the Black-box import flow
### General
* Vitis Model Composer now contains the functionality of Xilinx System Generator for DSP.  Users who have been using Xilinx System Generator for DSP can continue development using Vitis Model Composer.
* MATLAB Support - R2020a, R2020b, and R2021a
