# Model_Composer and System_Generator Examples

Starting from the 2020.2 version, we are storing and managing a subset of the product examples in GitHub. This way, users will always have access to the latest and most up-to-date examples. You can get the examples from this repository or directly from the tool. 

**If you are using this repository to get the examples, make sure you first switch to the branch corresponding to your version of the product.**
